# Udacity's 4th Project - Classic Aracade Game
An **object-oriented** project for Udacity's nanodegree scholarship of front-end web developers.

## Goal of the game
Goal of the game is that the player reaches the water. On the three block journey, the player must avoid colliding with the bugs (ie the enemy). If so, the player starts from the begining.

## How to play

1. Move up, down, left, right using arrow keys
2. Avoid colliding with the bugs
3. Start over

## Code

Starter code was given from Udacity. The code is focued in the use of objects. I 've got lots of help from (https://stackoverflow.com/) as well as the  study jams of slack fewd channel (https://slack.com/).
